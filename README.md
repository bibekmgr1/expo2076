# IoT Based Home Automation to Balance the load
Main theme of this project is to control the home appliances with mobile application during `peak/off` hours so that high consumption of the electricity is balanced by cutting the load based on the peak/off hours.

## Description
Here I created an api in python django which send/receive the data between the NodeMCU v1.0 and arduino along with current sensor so that output can be controlled based on the time and value set in the server.
